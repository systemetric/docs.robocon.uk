# The RoboCon Docs
Hosted on the subdomain https://docs.robocon.uk

Built with the Starlight docs framework, on Astro. Tailwind is installed.

If you are wondering how something works, look at the Starlight docs first before you look at the Astro ones - the functionality is slightly different!

Fonts are installed via Fontsource.

### to-do
/assets/markers.zip needs to exist, so does cytronboard.pdf and minibot assembly.
Brainbox imgs are old.
